# Auto-smelting-lite-version
This datapack only does one very simple thing:<br />
-Cooks all the ores (except nether gold ore).<br />
-If the version of minecraft allows it, it has compatibility with fortune.<br />
-Cooks them with any pickaxe and in any condition, as long as the player has mined the ore.<br />
**If you want something better, please use the full version.**
